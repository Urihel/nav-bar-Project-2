        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Urihel Coleman. I'm a student Web Developer. Well, up to this point i guess. Coding started off as
            a hobby as it still is. I pretty much taught myself how to code and continue to do that each day with documentation or 
            documentation i develop as i let my own mind do the plugging this time around. For the past two years i've been playing 
            around with code. Mostly Front-End, and the technologies behind it. Technologies such as: JavaScript, jQuery, Python 3, 
            HTML5, CSS3, gitBash, node.js, SASS, JSON, XML, C++. Being self-taught allowed me to explore all these avenues as mentioned
            above. Now to continue, I would like to take this time to describe how i got started and what am i doing with code today.
            for starters coding came to me as a suggestion. Most individuals dont take suggestions to kindly. So, I'm the complete 
            opposite of that. While taking into consideration the suggestion to see what web development was about, I stumbled onto 
            a ton of free documentation online. I didn't know what any of that stuff was at the time, but i still decided to explore, 
            and learn something new. One of the things i learned about myself early, on was that, i really enjoyed to develope new 
            skills and i didn't care if i had to read the material. Just as long as i had access to it, i always i was always stuck 
            on student mode learning that stuff up. With that being said, i followed up on some free coding bootcamps. While looking
            for coding material online. The first thing i ran into was Code Academy. When i started Code Academy, it was free.
            Everything was free. HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, SASS, javaScript, jQuery, C++, Command-line, ruby, ruby-on-rails, 
            react, angular, etc. I hit a little bit of everything. Alot of the course were pretty lengthy too, i think one out of the 
            three javaScript modules you could have access too was like 48hrs long. I personally wanted to start with an easy 
            language, and i didn't want to discouarge myself so i started with html and css. While i still hit javaScript first, the 
            reality is that it still took me a whole year to learn it. Everyday felt like a was playing with a jigsaw puzzle
            but with so many pieces the puzzle wasn't that easy to put together. During this time, I managed to build websites, but 
            nothing at the level where you could say hey i build serious websites. As time passed by, and my hunger to learn more 
            about code grew intensely. I followed up on a ad during the time i thought i was going crazy cuz i thought my computer 
            were on a serious level of tracking because when i'd search something, more of the same things popped up to from my last 
            search. 
            that dang search algorithm. Anyway, The ad that popped up was from Udemy. The ad had a couple things that sparked my interest. 
            The first web developer courses,
            and two for the price of lunch. Seriously, i bought a ton of courses in web development, advanced web development, python 3,
            jquery, javascript, OOP with javaScript, data stuctures & algorithms,etc. i also picked up a free 40+ hour c++ course which 
            ill get into getting how it helped me pass C++ 22A Intro to C++ at De Anza College. Since i bought all those course, i hit 
            the material pretty hard spending 16hr days on some occassions learing to build websites, learning to build basic apps,
            learing to just create content on the web. After the going strong for a year, i started making web pages but just as projects 
            at home javascript was finally making sense and i was getting eager to start taking it for a spin. The first thing i built 
            on my own letting my brain do all the work was this GUI that when clicked displayed a message. My next project i made was 
            the tip calculator, I've also made some password generators, 4 or 6 digit code generators if you need a code for your 
            Andriod/iOS phone, mac address generators, pixel art makers, Traffic Road Lights, Tip Calculator, a conversation bot, etc. 
            Every developer has touched these projects and so did i. Everyone of those projects i also coded on my own. Yet, i wanted
            to brew up my own version to see if i could finally put those puzzle pieces i was mentioning about. My eagerness continued,
            i wanted more, but i also wanted to challenge myself plus also make sure what i was writing was valid code you can use. Being
            self-taught i didn't have the fancy ivy league collge, no wait i did. MIT python 3 courses on youtube. Am i hope im not the
            only one that watched that during down time. Any who the thing is being self-taught means you don't have teachers, so 
            figuring out if your code is being written correctly is hard to say. In a sense, i wanted clarification. So 2018 fall
            quarter i register at De Anza College to take python 3. I got an A in the class. I will be honest, i really hit code labs. 
            the assignments were not to complicated. Alot of the projects in the beginning consisted of getting user input and using 
            if and else statements, while as the course continued for 12 weeks the remainder on the class focus on a function you can
            import called turle(). Turtle function allows you to draw graphics using a series of commands fun part is you can still 
            write python code. its just this time around in turtle you get some additional ones, plus a canvas to draw your graphics. 
            during this time, as well, i had sought out to connect myself with other coders while i was at school. So, i lived up to 
            the student lifestyle and joined a college club called Developers Guild. The club i joined focused on, breaking into groups 
            based on technologies. Like for instance if someone wanted to learn web development, and another student knew web dev he or
            she might take upon some leadership skills and maybe create a group where they would teach some students how to web dev or 
            help them out with their homework if they were stuck. I also joined up another group which competed in many of the school
            C++ tournaments. I joined mostly to gain more of knowledge of C++ not so much compete. I think the last time i saw the 
            standings the competition c++ group i joined placed De Anza in 1st in some nationals tournament. After the quarter had 
            ended, i began taking serious interest in C++ and began watching this sweet 40+hr free c++ course from the cave of 
            programming. I followed all the modules up until 50% of the course. That 50% of what i watched was about close the same 
            as what i was hearing in class. The video was amazing i was taught how to declare data types, and initializing value, how 
            to declared arrays, write functions, return values, how to ask for user input, passing arguaments into functions, 
            using f-stream and much more. during this time i had some skills from the js stuff so alot of the syntax was the same. 
            Winter quarter 2018 i enrolled into Intro to C++ 22A  at De Anza college again. this time around i decided to seriously 
            challenge myself. I decided to not buy the book and use the resources i had. With the 50% of what i watch and practiced 
            at home i was able to walk out with a C i guess barely passing the class. But i passed it and I dont have to repeat it.
            22B intermediate C++ you can say has been unlocked. This class really put me to the test, 12 weeks with homework, midterms,
            finals. I no longer had the flexibilty to sleep on problem and come back to it later when i skilled up. Some new areas
            i picked up taking c++ in college was pass-by-reference. Also i fully grabbed to fstream. fstream for those that don't
            allows you to gain access to your .txt files and basically write or read data. Im currently using both on a small but fun 
            intermediate project in C++. I'm building a ficticious banking system that allows you open checking and savings account
            in my code i used pass-by-reference to pass the variables in int main function as argument in a getData function which 
            collects user input and assigns that user input to the arguments/parameters i passed in as reference as its value. I later 
            use fstream to store the clients data onto a txt file so i can read and output some lines later on in the compiler with code.
            I am now 2 quarters away from graduating at de anza and looking to continue studying coding but now at a higher level i
            guess at a local university or online universit. In addition after i complete the entire front end to this portfolio. I 
            am going to try to build even a simple backend in javaScript to host my portfolio from my laptop. Its not going to be 
            fancy its just gonna host my page. </p>
