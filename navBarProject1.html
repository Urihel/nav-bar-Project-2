        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Urihel Coleman. I consider myself a student dispite the fact i thought myself to code
and have been happily going at with code for the past 2 years now. I've got alot to tell you. Mostly how i got started, 
and what additional steps i took after i got started, and what i do with code today. To start off, coding was approached to 
me as a suggestion. most individuals dont take suggestions to kindly. I'm the opposite of that. While taking into consideration 
the suggestion to see what web development was about. I stumbled onto tons of free material all online. I didn't know what any of 
that stuff was at the time, but i still decided to explore and learn something new. One of the things i learned about myself early
on was that i really enjoyed to develope new skills and i didn't care if i had to read the material. Just as long as i had access 
to it, i always turned into a student. With that being said, i followed up on some free coding bootcamps while looking for coding 
material online. The first bootcamp i touched was code academy. My gosh, i remember how completely free the bootcamp was. I took 
all the free html, css, and javascript course. Many of the html courses were as long as 40hrs. Their were more i took, like 
command-line, ruby, ruby-on-rails, java, c++, react, etc. Now, despite the lanuguages mentioned my main focus when it came to 
learning how to code was html,css,and javascript. I wanted to start with an easy language, and i didn't want to discouarge myself
so i started with html and css. javascript on the other took me a whole year to learn. everyday felt like a jigsaw puzzle was 
given to me but i could make out the pieces. I managed to build websites, but nothing at the level where you could say hey 
i build serious websites. As time pasted by, and my hunger to learn more about coding i followed up on a ad during the time 
i think i was going crazy cuz i thought my computer was following me. agghHH search algorithm. Yeah! well one of those ads that 
popped up turned out to be udemy. The ad said learn coding for the price of lunch. I went bats shit crazy when i heard that. No 
seriously i bought a ton of courses in web development, advanced web development, python 3, jquery, javascript, data stuctures & algorithms,etc. 
i also picked up a free 40+ hour c++ course which ill get into getting how it helped me pass C++ 22A Into to C++ at De Anza College.
Back to the main topic, i hit the material pretty hard spending 16hr days learing to build websites, learning to build basic apps,
learing to just create content on the web. After the going strong for a year, i started making web pages but just as projects at home
javascript was finally making sense and i was getting eager to start taking it for a spin. the first thing i built on my own 
letting my brain do all the work was this GUI that when clicked displayed a message. My next project i made was the tip calculator.
everyone has probably built already, but again at the time and with books closed this time around i was making that calculator work. 
as my eagerness to code continued, i decided i wanted more, i wanted to challenge myself, and i also wanted to make sure what i 
was writing was valid code. Being self-taught i didn't have the fancy ivy league actually no wait i did. MIT has classes for free 
on youtube. I watched those classes. the fact of the matter was that i didn't have a teacher to tell me my code was right
or wrong. I wanted clarification, so i signed up for the fall quarter at deanza and took python 3. I got an A in the class, it was pretty 
easy being an intro class, but one of the things i wanted out of it was 
clarification with writting code and i acutally learned a few new things in the class. Like using the turtle object, and using 
the fundamentals in python to use the turtle to draw graphics on the screen. that same quarter i also joined a club at school called
The Developers Guild seeking to learn more about coding, interact with students seeking the same goals with coding, meeting new 
people, developing new skills, working on projects, and more. After the quarter had ended, i began taking serious interest in 
C++ and began watching this sweet 40+hr free c++ course from the cave of programming. I followed all the modules up until 50% of the course.
i learned alot about c++, such  as declareing data types and initializing value, how to declared arrays, write functions, return 
values, how to ask for user input, passing arguaments into functions, using f-stream and much more. during this time i had some skills from 
the js stuff so alot of the syntax was the same. Winter quarter i enrolled into Intro to C++ 2018 at De Anza college again. 
this time around i decided to seriously challenge myself. i decided to not buy the book and use the resources i had. With 
the 50% of what i watch and practiced at home i was able to walk out with a C i guess barely passing the class. But i passed it.
i had new concept thrown at me and i was also being time 12 weeks. i wonder how some not nowing anything did. So it really put my 
self-thaught education threw a huge test
of knowledge. Some new concepts that got me stuck for a small minute was pass-by-reference which i so adore using now in c++
now that i know how to use it. Pointers, i still haven't understood how to really use it but i know about its existance, and also 
fstream which i learned how use and now have c++ interact with .txt files and either read data and output it on the compiler, and
continously log data to a txt file without ever over-writing the exisiting content. I am now 2 quarters away from graduating at de anza 
and looking to continue studying coding but now at a higher level at a local university or online university. </p>
