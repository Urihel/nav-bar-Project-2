# nav-bar-Project-2

# Project Description:
Working on build a new coding portfolio to help me land a job in coding or for the most part be happy to put one a resume when applying for work. The nav bar im building is currently in working progress. it's in this stage mainly, becuase i'm trying to actually design things, so in this process im putting things up and taking things down as im letting my ideas flow on the screen with HTML, CSS, &javaScript. While, i can code, i'm not very good at designing and making things look like super pretty so this project is giving me a chance at designing simple html tags with css and laying them out where i want them to be. Before i submit my next update on github regarding the project i hope to have made a responsive nav bar that you can play around with when you change the size orientation of the browser. feel free to copy and paste since it will be used as documentation on my webpage and it also gives you a chance at seeing how one is made at random from a random developer like me. Happy Coding!!!!
